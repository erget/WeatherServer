# Welcome to Full Stack Embedded
We've got a mission and we won't stop till we drop.

For some reason, the JS stuff isn't locally. I thought it might be because
there was some problem with the project, but apparently that's not the issue.
Now both pages have stopped - the reference page under
FullStackEmbedded.github.io and this one. So I'm thinking it's because my
jQuery scritp is no longer cached, probably because I did a forced full reload.
Stupid me, doing that with no internet connection. Will try again from home.

Ultimately I'd like to abstract this out into a template. Maybe I'll make some
blog areas open to the individual group projects, they can all contribute and
send pull requests and we'll have a record of everything they've ever done
without them having to worry about branding and the like. And if they want we
can always give them additional layouts and modifications and that kind of
stuff.

By the way, we still need a logo! Hot damn. We could use that the footer, and
link to somewhere cooler - perhaps GitHub for now, but at some later date maybe
the project report from IoG, if we decide to go with IoG? Weight and sea.
